# Webjeda Hagura Theme

[**Demo**](http://webjeda.com/hagura)

Hagura is a theme made for blogs with long text paragraphs. Made to be easy on eyes as well with a switchable theme.

Suitable fonts are selected for better readability. Since the theme is created for smartphone reading, the theme is very light and it loads instantly even on a slow data connection.

The theme comes with pre-installed analytics, disqus and html compressor. But make sure you change key parameters in the _config.yml file.


# Installation: 
Fork the ``master`` branch and delete ``gh-pages`` branch in it. This is important because ``gh-pages`` branch is used here only to host the blog. You should be using the master branch as the source and create a fresh ``gh-pages`` branch.

Now, go to settings and check the **Github Pages** section. You should see a URL where the blog is hosted.

This process will host the theme as a **Project Page**. You can also download the files for local development. 

Default theme will look like this
